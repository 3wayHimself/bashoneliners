        <p> If you have posted One-Liners before, then this message is for you.
            We recently migrated to modern social authentication.
            We were not able to match the old OpenID accounts to the new social logins automatically.
            We can do it manually if you tell us the links to the old and new accounts,
            and if we can verify your ownership.
            The ownership is sometimes obvious, by meta information in the old OpenID and the new social logins,
            but sometimes not, and we need to find some other ways and email discussions to make the connection.
            We're very sorry about this inconvenience.</p>

        <p>
            Please fill the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3VJ8L4-f-WHimHb6KsSfx22gDnVdobmGBKn4C3KRNOao8DA/viewform">Bash One-Liners - Re-link accounts form</a>
            so that we can re-link your old profile with the new one.
            Once that's done, you will have to logout and log back in to have your old posts.
        </p>
