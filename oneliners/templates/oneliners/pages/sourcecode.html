This page should give you all the links,
resources and contact info that you might need to participate in this project.
Do <a href="mailto:info@bashoneliners.com">let us know</a> if we missed something.
</p>

<p>Right now the site is still pretty far from what we want it to be.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Perfect one-liners following today's best-practices:</strong>
        Expert users should be able to edit and improve poorly written one-liners.
        The site needs peer-review and collaborative editing features,
        similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a>.
        Keep in mind that StackOverflow is about questions and answers.
        On StackOverflow, answers do not collaborate with each other,
        and very often the accepted answer is not the best solution.
        Very often the combination of multiple answers is the best solution.
        Our goal here is to encourage users to optimize the heck out of every single one-liner until it is perfect.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Gamification:</strong>
        Gamification features are probably crucial to attract more users,
        and for keeping existing users interested.
        Designing the system is a very complex subject,
        it takes much more than just coding.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To make all these things happen we need more Django coders,
espeically with gamification experience.</p>
